## Overview

This is a personal project and serves as a demonstration of using machine learning for binary classification. Several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree, were applied to predict heart disease.

## Dataset

The original dataset used for this project is available in the 'dataset' directory. You can find a detailed description of the dataset and the original data in the 'dataset_description.docx' file. This document explains the features and the target variable, as well as any preprocessing steps applied to the data.

## Usage

To use this code for heart disease prediction:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find these in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Execute the provided Python scripts to run the machine learning models.

For example, to run the Logistic Regression model:

```bash
python logistic_regression.py
